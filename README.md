# Minimal MacBook Pro Landing Page

Welcome to the **Minimal MacBook Pro Landing Page** project! This project aims to create a sleek, minimalistic landing page inspired by Apple's design aesthetics. The landing page features a 3D model of a MacBook Pro that comes to life as you scroll, smoothly opening up to reveal the screen. The design includes clean lines, modern animations, and a stylish gradient on the text, all contributing to a polished and professional look.

# React + Vite
This landing page provides a setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
